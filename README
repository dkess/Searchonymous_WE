Searchonymous prevents your Google searches from being associated with your Google account by disabling cookies on search queries. You will remained logged in on other Google services. It also injects a small css file (see `google.css`) to disable privacy hints that would otherwise show up.

Note that you are still potentially vulnerable to tracking based on IP address, user agent, and [https://panopticlick.eff.org/](browser fingerprinting).

The code for this Firefox extension was not written by me; it was written by Github user Morbz and the original repository can be found at [github.com/MorbZ/Searchonymous](https://github.com/MorbZ/Searchonymous). The original Firefox version is not a WebExtension and therefore incompatible with Firefox 57+. The code in this repository is simply the Chrome version ported to a Firefox WebExtension.
